# Chat_Application

https://chat-application-pandeyankit123.vercel.app/

This is a simple Chat application created by me while trying to learn more about ReactJS and its applications with Web Sockets.

I have used the following technologies:-

1. `ReactJs`.

2. `NodeJS`.

3. `SocketIO`.

4. `CORS`.

5. `ExpressJS`.



The app serves the following functionalities :-

1. `Login` and `Exit` the ChatRoom.

2. The Creator of a new ChatRoom becomes the `admin`.

3. The `emoji` option is although yet to be enabled, but the keybords sign can be used.

4. `End-to-End` chat messages delivery.

5.  `1 Hour` Time Limit.

Although I learned quite a lot while trying to build this app, but further improvements are yet to be made:-

1. Adding `Phtotos and Media Files` by a user to the ChatRoom.

2. Provision of the `Admin Rights` to the Room-Admin.
